#### Note:
> Strengthened my understanding of CSS Position, CSS Grid, and CSS Flexbox
> 
> Learnt how to build a Hamburger Menu
> 
> Learnt using animation with CSS and JavaScript  
> 
> Learnt that it is better to use percentage for 'width' and 'height' in CSS instead of using a fixed number as it will make the screen responsive.
>
> Learnt to use CSS Properties such as 'transition', 'transform', and 'filter'.
>
> Learnt that each <source> element in HTML represents a different source image and can include a 'media' attribute and a 'srcset' attribute.
> 'media="(min-width: 768px)"'. This 'media' attribute specifies a condition for when to use this source image. In this project's case, it says to use the 'source' when the viewport width is at least 768 pixels.
